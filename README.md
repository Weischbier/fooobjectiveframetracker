# FoOFT - WoW Addon

Fuck off ObjectiveFrameTracker (FoOFT) is a World of Warcraft addon that provides a convenient way to toggle the visibility of the default Objective Tracker frame. This can be useful for players who want quick access to their quest objectives without cluttering their screen.

## Features

- Toggle visibility of the Objective Tracker frame with a customizable key binding.
- Automatically hides the Objective Tracker frame on entering the world if the previous state was saved.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/Weischbier/fooobjectiveframetracker/releases/tag/rel) page.
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP file into your WoW `Interface/AddOns` directory.

## Usage

- By default, the addon toggles the Objective Tracker frame visibility using the key binding "Toggle Visibility" (settable in the WoW key bindings menu).
- The frame is automatically hidden on entering the world if the previous state was saved.

## Configuration

The addon uses the default settings, and the state (visible or hidden) is saved between sessions. You can customize the key binding through the WoW key bindings menu.
